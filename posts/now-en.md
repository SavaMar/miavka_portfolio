## READING

Right now, I’m listening "The courage to be disliked" written by Fumitake Koga, Ichiro Kishimi and reading "E-Myth" by Michael E. Gerber.

and amazing book of Stiven Strogatz "Infinite Powers: How Calculus Reveals the Secrets of the Universe"

## WORK

At the moment, I’m passionately working on three projects:

**1.** This blog — the portfolio you’re reading right now. All the design and code were created by me from scratch, simply because I find it interesting and exciting. I’ve rebuilt it several times, and only now do I finally "see" what I want it to be. It’s truly captivating.

**2.** I came up with a project for Ukrainians in Switzerland. The project itself isn’t exactly news, but after many iterations, I finally have a vision for what I want it to be and how it should develop. I can’t wait to launch it, as it will be my first big project!

A bit of background: I’ve been living in Switzerland for 6 years, and since the start of the war, I’ve managed several "Ukrainians in Switzerland" chats. Back then, it was a necessity — the beginning of the war was chaos, and we had to help government workers and share the latest information with everyone fleeing the war. There was no order, just total chaos. Everything was passed from person to person, and the government itself had no internal regulation — which is not the case today.

Over the years of war, Switzerland has developed structure, organizations, and step-by-step instructions for newcomers. People have started to adapt and live. New shops, restaurants, businesses, interesting people! But all of this is lost among chats, mixed with ads, scams, or good announcements that no one notices in the stream of "noise" — I decided to try to change this, bring something new, and help us find each other in a more human way.

You can click around the draft of my project here: [svoii.ch](https://svoii.ch), and if you’re interested in what, how, or want to contribute — here’s the [telegram chat](https://t.me/+RcRMiysu4vQ0NDUy).

**3.** The third project is a logical continuation of my small [Jiu Jitsu events project](https://swissbjj.ch/en) in Switzerland, but now with potential clients and investors, and the opening of a company :) It’s going to be exciting!

## LIFE

My boyfriend found a new job, and at the new job, they expect us to move closer. There are a few nuances to this story. First: my dog isn’t allowed everywhere. Since I have an American Bully — a breed that’s considered "dangerous" here and there — this means the rules differ from country to country. The "beauty" of Switzerland is that it’s a country made up of countries (cantons) inside, so the rules can vary from one canton to another. This affects our mobility, plus there’s the extra challenge of finding a place to live where pets are allowed.

We’ve looked at a few apartments, and I really liked one of them... right now we’re sending in all the documents, and if things go the way I really, really hope, it will affect a huge number of things.

## SOMETHING ELSE

I started learning French. I used to always joke about it and thought French was a definite "no" for me, but over time I realized that the French-speaking part of Switzerland is more lively, people are more open, and the language, once you get into it, actually appeals to me much more. For context: I lived in Berlin briefly, then in Zurich, and then near Bern — in total, that’s 7 years in the German-speaking world, and with a lot of "pain" and reluctance, I passed the B1 spoken German exam, and even then... only because I knew exactly what I’d be asked — I memorized the text. I avoided German for many years, and now — suddenly, out of nowhere, I’ve found a love and some kind of joy in French... The new apartment we applied for is in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, and for the first time in my life, I looked at the language without disgust or fear, but with a sense of new possibilities and new experiences. It’s not scary — on the contrary! It’s very exciting and inspiring!
