# About Me

So yeah, I’m from Kyiv. I’ve got a trophy and some medals from Bike Downhill competitions across Ukraine — that used to be super cool and fun. I’ve lived in Krakow (Poland), Berlin (Germany), Zurich (Switzerland), and now I’m based in a tiny Swiss village surrounded by cows, farmers, and endless fields. That’s where I live at the moment.

I’ve tattooed two pieces on myself — they’re beautiful and I adore them.
Once, I launched a kinda-failed–kinda-successful Kickstarter. I didn’t hit my planned numbers in time, but I still sold more Jiu-Jitsu gear than I originally aimed for. So yeah, success in disguise.

Somehow I ended up being the person who photographs nearly every Jiu-Jitsu competition in Switzerland. I’ve got an American Bully with a Slovak passport, and I love her endlessly.

I’ve started a couple of projects and now I’m coding for them. Between all that, I draw silly things, or make collages out of my own photos.

Right now, I deeply love and value my freedom of thought, my life, and everything I have.
But behind that inner lightness and freedom, there’s a path:
I’ve been through caring for someone I loved through cancer, the war in Ukraine, falling off a cliff, knee surgery, and divorce.
I carry all of that with me as a reminder:

Life is finite.

“Create and leave something behind” — that’s my drive to write, draw, and express myself boldly.

Live, don’t imitate.

That last one is mostly for myself.
Because yes, a lot of things are scary, confusing, and sometimes it feels like everyone else has it all figured out, and you’re the only silly one just winging it — but that’s an illusion.
And illusion doesn’t go well with life.
Illusion is avoiding life.
So I’m learning to be brave, to try, and to befriend my fears — just as they are.

So that’s me:
I ride DH and Pump Track, sometimes go to Jiu-Jitsu, take photos, write code, can’t run much since the knee surgery but I’m always making stuff up, reading, trying, learning, and staying endlessly curious.
